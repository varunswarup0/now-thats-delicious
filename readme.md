Now That's Delicious is a highly extensible open-source **Redux-Thunk** application on the [React](https://reactjs.org/) framework. Now That's Delicious is developed to deliver robust **fast and scalable results** while providing an **intuitive and extensible administration toolkit** to manage the full content lifecycle.

This full stack restaurant application is built using **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/)**, **Express**, **MongoDB**(mlab & MongoDB Compass), **Passport.js** and some more npms.
It is designed with today's application essentials such as user authentication, database storage, Ajax REST API, file upload and image resizing.

## üì´ Have a question? Want to chat? Ran into a problem?

Need some help? Want to chat with the other learners? The Slack Chat that accompanies this course is where you should be asking questions ‚Äî this repo is meant as a place to grab the starter files and isn't a support channel.

## ü§ù Found a bug? Missing a specific feature?

If you found a different / better way to solve problems in the application, great! These files are meant to be as close to 1:1 as they are shown in the videos so I generally won't accept any pull requests for changing how the application functions.

Glaring errors, clarifications and files that aren't shown in the videos are totally fair game for pull requests and are appreciated.

Enjoy!

## ‚úÖ Requirements

Now That's Delicious requires a **Node version higher or equal to v12.16.1.0** and is compatible with every **npm version starting from 6.14.4**.

## üìòLicense
